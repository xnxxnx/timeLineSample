# Timeline Js Sample

This is a sample about using [timeline.js](https://timeline.knightlab.com/?utm_campaign=elearningindustry.com&utm_source=%2Ftop-10-free-timeline-creation-tools-for-teachers&utm_medium=link) to create a timeline.

The most significant feature of this timeline.js is it allows user to use not only a google spreadsheet but also json file.
Since this is a very simple exmaple about this timeline, so I just create a object with all events I need and pass it to timeline (a static way, [index.js](./index.js)). It's almost same if you have a json file and use ajax to get this json data.
